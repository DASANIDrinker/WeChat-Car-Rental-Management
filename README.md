## Project Intro:
A Car Rental Application's management system for staff. 

## Project Description:
The management system is implemented by Vue.js along with ElementUI which is a open-source UI library.

The basic functionality of this system consists of creation, update and deletion of different Java objects.
For example, the staff can create a new type of vehicle by entering the brand and model as well as displacement etc.
The staff can also edit a vehicle type based on its boxes, seats and style etc. 
The vehicle type can be deleted if such model is obsolete.

On top of the basic function, management system also allows creation, deletion and update on driver's
ID and license. The images will be created, deleted and updated correspondingly on the server.
